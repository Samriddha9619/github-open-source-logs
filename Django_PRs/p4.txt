## PR #4: Clarified migration behavior for ManyToManyField transitions and UniqueConstraint usage  
**Ticket:** [#35877](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35877)  
**Status:** Merged  
**PR Link:** [github.com/Samriddha9619/django/pull/19886](https://github.com/Samriddha9619/django/pull/19886)

### Summary
- Improved migration documentation to clarify behavior when switching from an implicit `ManyToManyField` to a custom `through` model.
- Highlighted that Django does not automatically preserve the unique index on foreign keys during this transition.
- Advised contributors to manually add a `UniqueConstraint` to maintain consistent behavior across database backends.
- Moved guidance about constraint naming into the surrounding paragraph for clarity and consistency with Django’s doc style.

### Reflections
- First merged contribution to Django—focused on migration clarity and backend consistency.
- Learned how Django handles implicit vs custom `through` models and the impact on constraints.
- Practiced writing precise, reviewer-friendly documentation and responding to feedback with humility.
- Understood the importance of clean commit history—will be more mindful about squashing and tidiness in future PRs.
- Felt proud of surfacing a subtle behavior and offering a proactive fix that improves contributor experience.

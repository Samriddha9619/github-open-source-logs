PR #4: Improve migration docs for UniqueConstraint(nulls_distinct) and ManyToMany transitions
Ticket: #35877
Status: Open
PR Link: https://github.com/Samriddha9619/django/pull/19886

Summary:
- Updated migration documentation to clarify behavior when switching from an implicit ManyToManyField to a custom through model.
- Explained that Django does not automatically preserve the unique index on foreign keys during this transition.
- Advised contributors to manually add a UniqueConstraint to maintain consistent behavior across database backends.
- Aimed to prevent subtle bugs and improve migration reliability for users.

Reflections:
- First contribution focused on migration documentation clarity and backend consistency.
- Learned how Django handles implicit vs custom through models and the impact on constraints.
- Practiced writing educational notes that balance precision and accessibility.
- Felt proud of anticipating contributor confusion and offering a proactive fix.

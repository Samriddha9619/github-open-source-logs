ðŸ§¾ PR #3: Introduced process_lhs() method to Transform for API consistency Ticket: #24886 Status: Open PR Link: github.com/Samriddha9619/django/pull/19885

Summary:

Added process_lhs() to the Transform base class to mirror the Lookup API.

Improves consistency in SQL generation and prepares transforms for future refactors.

Scoped changeâ€”no functional impact, no new tests required.

Removed Upper refactor after test failures to keep patch clean and focused.

Reflections:

First structural PR aimed at internal API consistency.

Learned how Django compiles SQL expressions and how Transform interacts with Lookup.

Practiced scoping changes tightly and communicating intent clearly in the PR description.

Felt confident navigating CI failures, isolating lint issues, and keeping the patch contributor-ready.
